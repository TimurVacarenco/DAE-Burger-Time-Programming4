My game engine is based on Minigin Engine from DAE Howest
My main design choices are:
1) Game Loop( Update method)
2) Component (Decoupling pattern)
3) Dirty flag ( optimiztation pattern)
4) Command and PImpl patterns
5) Observers and events
6) Threading( only sound vise on very basic level)
7) Singleton pattern
8) State pattern

For some reason build in x64 folder is not working, even though Building from visual studio works fine
